The `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/storage` package is used to perform operations in Azure Storage Service. To manage your storage accounts (Azure Resource Manager / ARM), use the [github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/arm/storage](../arm/storage) package. For your classic storage accounts (Azure Service Management / ASM), use [github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/management/storageservice](../management/storageservice) package.

This package includes support for [Azure Storage Emulator](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-use-emulator/)
