# Specification for Celo IBFT protocol

## Celo IBFT specification

This document is an attempt to specify at a conceptual level the consensus
algorithm currently used by the Celo blockchain. It attempts to distill
everything that is pertinent to consensus and eschew all that is not. Where
consensus is the problem of agreeing on a sequence of values in a decentralized
manner.

It is not trying to specify everything that lives under `consensus/istanbul`.

By doing this we allow for a clean and clear specification of the consensus,
as a consequence this specification does not closely resemble the code and
mapping this to the code and vice versa, requires considerable effort.

### High level overview

The Celo IBFT protocol is a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) protocol that allows
a group of participants (commonly referred to as validators in the Celo
ecosystem) to agree on the ordering of values by exchanging voting messages
across a network. The voting proceeds in rounds and for each round a specific
participant is able to propose the value to be agreed upon, they are known as
the proposer. As long as less than 1/3rd of participants deviate from the
protocol then the protocol should ensure that there is only one ordering of
values that participants agree on and also that they can continue to agree on
new values, i.e. they don't get stuck.

Ensuring that only one ordering is agreed upon is referred to as 'safety' and
ensuring that the participants can continue to agree on new values is referred
to as 'liveness'.

### System model

We consider a group of `3f+1` participating computers (participants) that are
able to communicate across a network. The group should be able to tolerate `f`
failures without losing liveness or safety.

All participants know the other participants in the system and it is assumed
that all messages are signed in some way such that participants in the protocol
know which participant a message came from and that messages cannot be forged.

Only messages from participants are considered.

The Msgs variable holds all the messages ever received by a participant except
for messages explicitly removed by the consensus algorithm.

When considering sets of messages denoted by either `M` or `N` (this doesn't
apply to Msgs) only messages from distinct participants are considered, I.E
sets denoted by `M` or `N` cannot contain more than one message from any
participant.

For messages containing a value, only messages with valid values are considered.

Participants are able to broadcast messages to all other participants. In the
case that a participant is off-line or somehow inaccessible they will not
receive broadcast messages and except for round change messages there is no
mechanism for these messages to be re-sent.

In the case of round change messages they are periodically re-broadcast.

We refer to a consensus instance to mean consensus for a specific height.

We assume the existence of an application that feeds values to be agreed upon
to the consensus instance and also receives agreed upon values from the
consensus. The application also provides application specific implementations
for certain functions that the consensus algorithm relies upon, such as a
function that determines the validity of a value. 

### Algorithm

See supporting [functions](#Functions) and [notation](#Appendix-1-Notation).

Note all state modifications are contained in the following code block,
supporting functions do not modify state, they all operate without side
effects.

```

#### validPC

Returns true if the message set contains prepare or commit messages from at
least 2f+1 and no more than 3f+1 participants for current height, matching the
prepared certificate value and all sharing the same height and round.
```
validPC(<PreparedCertificate, M, V>) {

round changes for the current height, with a round greater or equal to the
desired round and either have a valid prepared certificate or no prepared
certificate. If any round change certificates have a prepared certificate, then
there must exist one with round greater than or equal to all the others and
with a value of V.

```
validRCC(V, RCC) {
  M ← { m<RoundChange, Hm , Rm, PC> ∈ RCC : Hm = Hc && Rm >= Rd && (PC = nil || validPC(PC)) }

lowest round from the top f+1 rounds.
```
f1Round() {
  // This is saying that for any Rm there cannot be >= f+1 elements set with a
  // larger R, since if there were that would mean that Rm is not in the top
  // f+1 rounds.

  return R
}
```

## Appendix 1: Notation
Message sets are represented as `M` if there is need to represent more than one
message set within a single scope then `N` is used for the other message set.
Elements of sets are represented with lower case letters (e.g. `m ∈ M`).
Because all sets are messages we use `m` to represent an element and if we need
to denote 2 messages from the same set we use `n` to denote the second message.
Other variables are represented with Upper case letters (e.g. `H` for height).

Composite objects are defined by a set of comma separated variables enclosed in
angled brackets.\
E.g. `<A, B, C>`

If we need to refer to the composite object we prefix the angled brackets with
an identifier that is a lower case letter.\
E.g. `m<A, B, C>`

An identifier can also be provided in order to distinguish variables belonging
to a composite object from other similarly named variables in the same scope.
In this case the variables are annotated with the identifier by appending the
identifier to the variable name.\
E.g. `m<Am, Bm, Cm>`

If all instances of a composite object element share the same value for one
of its variables then that value can be used in the definition. E.g. `<A, B, Hc>`
represents a composite element with variables `A` `B` and current height.

If a composite object element has variables for which the value is not
important then `*` is used in the place of that variable.

### Numbers of participants
`3f+1 - the total number of participants`\
`2f+1 - a quorum of participants`
`f - the number of failed or malicious participants that the system can tolerate`

### Participant states
`AcceptRequest`\
`Preprepared`\
`Prepared`\
`Committed`\
`WaitingForNewRound`

### Application defined values
`MIN_RESEND_ROUNDCHANGE_TIMEOUT`\
`MAX_RESEND_ROUNDCHANGE_TIMEOUT`

### Variable names
`S - participant state`\
`H - height`\
`R - round`\
`V - value`\
`T - Message type`\
`RCC - round change certificate`\
`PC - prepared certificate`\
`M or N - message sets`\
`nil - indicates that the relevant variable is not set`

### Message composite object structures
`<Preprepare, H, R, V, RCC>`\
`<Prepare, H, R, V>`\
`<Commit, H, R, V>`\
`<RoundChange, H, R, PC>`\
`<PreparedCertificate, M, V>`

### Event composite object structures
Events are a means for the application to communicate with the consensus
instance, they are never sent across the network.

`<RequestEvent, H, V> - request event, provides the value for the proposer to propose`\
`<FinalCommittedEvent> - final committed event, sent by the application to initiate a new consensus instance`

### Pseudocode notation
```
Function definitions are represented as follows where the name of the function is foo, its
parameters are X and Y, functions can optionally return a value.

foo(X, Y) {
  ...  
  return X
}
```
```
Conditional statements are represented as follows where statements inside only
one set of the curly braces will be executed if the corresponding condition C
evaluates to true or in the case of the final else those statements will be
executed if none of the previous conditions evaluated to true. 

if C {
  ...  
} else if C {
  ...  
} else {
  ...  
}
```
```
upon: UponCondition - Pseudocode directly following upon statements is executed
when the associated UponCondition evaluates to true

Upon conditions are structured thus:

<composite object, set of objects or event to match against> <additional qualifications>

E.G:
// 2f+1 commit messages for the current round and height with a non nil value.
M ← <Commit, Hc, Rc, V> && |M| = 2f+1 && V != nil
```
```
schedule <function call> after <duration> - This notation schedules the given
function call to occur after the given duration.

```

### Math notation
`← - assignment`\
`= - is equal`\
`!= - is not equal`\
`&& - logical and`\
`|| - logical or`\
`{X, Y} - the set containing X and Y`\
`|M| - the cardinality of M`\
`m ∈ M - m is an element of the set M`\
`{ m : C(m) } - set builder notation, the set of messages m such that they satisfy condition C`\
`∃ m : C(m) - there exists m that satisfies condition C`\
`∀ m : C(m) - all m satisfy condition C`\
`M/N - Set difference, the set containing all elements of M and no elements of N`

### Math Notation examples
```
// There exists a commit message m in M such that m's height (Hm) is
// less than m's round (Rm) and m's value (V) is not important.
∃ m<Commit, H, R, *> ∈ M : Hm < Rm

// The cardinality of prepare messages in M with height and round equal
// to Hc and value equal to V is greater than 1 and less than 10.
1 < |{ m<Prepare, Hc, Rm, Vm> ∈ M : Rm = Hc && Vm = V }| < 10
```

## Appendix 2: Notes

### What do the prepared certificate and round change certificate do?

They enforce that if it’s possible that a node could have confirmed a block in
a round, then all remaining nodes in future rounds can only confirm the same
block.

- A node could have confirmed a block if 2f+1 nodes send commit messages for a
  block.
- If a node sends a commit message for a block then it must have seen 2f+1
  prepares or commits for that block and therefore must have a prepared
  certificate.
- Therefore there must be at least 2f+1 nodes with prepared certificates for a
  block if 2f+1 nodes have sent commit messages for a block.
- When the proposer proposes in the next round they must provide a round change
  certificate with 2f+1 round change messages.
- When nodes send round change messages they should include the prepared
  certificate if they have one.
- So if 2f+1 nodes have prepared certificates then f nodes do not.
- If the proposer of the next round includes the f round change messages from
  the nodes that do not have prepared certificates, and if there are a further
  f byzantine nodes that do not include their prepared certificate even if they
  had one, there still remains one round change message that must come from a
  non byzantine node and must include a prepared certificate.
