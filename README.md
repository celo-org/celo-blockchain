## Celo Blockchain

Official golang implementation of the Celo blockchain, based off of the [official golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum).

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join%20chat-blue.svg)](https://chat.celo.org)

Prebuilt [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_\(software\)) images are available for immediate use: [us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/celo-node](https://us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/celo-node). See [docs.celo.org/getting-started](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started) for a guide to the Celo networks and how to get started.

Documentation for Celo more generally can be found at [docs.celo.org](https://docs.celo.org/)

Most functionality of this client is similar to `go-ethereum`, also known as `geth`, from which it was forked. If you do not find your question answered by Celo-specific documentation, try searching the [geth wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki).

## Building the source

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.13) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The Celo blockchain client comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`geth`** | The main Celo Blockchain client. It is the entry point into the Celo network, capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state), light node (retrieving data live), or lightest node (retrieving minimum number of block headers to verify existing validator set). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Celo network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [Ethereum CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options. |
| `abigen` | Source code generator to convert Celo contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see [Ethereum's Native DApps](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Native-DApps:-Go-bindings-to-Ethereum-contracts) wiki page for details. |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of the Celo client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks. |
| `evm` | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug`). |
| `gethrpctest` | Developer utility tool to support the [ethereum/rpc-test](https://github.com/ethereum/rpc-tests) test suite which validates baseline conformity to the [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) specs. Please see the [ethereum test suite's readme](https://github.com/ethereum/rpc-tests/blob/master/README.md) for details. |
| `rlpdump` | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP)) dumps (data encoding used by the Celo protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`). |

## Running Celo

Please see the [docs.celo.org/getting-started](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started) for instructions on how to run a node connected the Celo network using the prebuilt Docker image.

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here, please consult `geth --help` for more complete information.
We've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your own Celo blockchain client instance.

### Full node on the main Celo network

By default, the Celo client will connect to the Mainnet.
Running the following command will create a full node that will sync with the Celo network and allow access to all of its functionality.

```shell
$ geth --syncmode full console
```

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in full sync mode which will download and execute all historical block information.
 * Start up `geth`'s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as `geth`'s own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Alfajores test network

Smart contract developers will be most interested in the Alfajores testnet.
On Alfajores, you can receive testnet Celo Gold through the [Alfajores faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) and deploy smart contracts in an environment very simmialr to Mainnet.
More information about the Alfajores testnet can be found on [docs.celo.org](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet).

```shell
$ geth --alfajores --syncmode full console
```

*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always
use separate accounts for testnet-tokens and real-tokens. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Full node on the Baklava test network

Validators and full node operators will be most interested in the Baklava testnet.
On Baklava, you can receive a distribution of testnet Celo Gold to become a validator on the network and test out running a validator for the first time, or try out new infrastructure.
More information about the Baklava testnet can be found on [docs.celo.org](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet).
A full guide to getting started as a validator on Baklava can be found in the [Getting Started guides](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet/running-a-validator-in-baklava)

```shell
$ geth --baklava --syncmode full console
```

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `Celo` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Celo network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--rpcapi` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--wsapi` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Celo nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**
