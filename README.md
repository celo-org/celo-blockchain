>>>>>>> v1.10.7

Prebuilt [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_\(software\)) images are available for immediate use: [us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/celo-node](https://us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/celo-node). See [docs.celo.org/getting-started](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/choosing-a-network) for a guide to the Celo networks and how to get started.

Documentation for Celo more generally can be found at [docs.celo.org](https://docs.celo.org/)

Most functionality of this client is similar to `go-ethereum`, also known as `geth`, from which it was forked. If you do not find your question answered by Celo-specific documentation, try searching the [geth wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki).

## Building the source

<<<<<<< HEAD
Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.16) and a C compiler.

=======
For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.14 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run
>>>>>>> v1.10.7

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

### Mobile Clients

There are two different commands in the `Makefile` to build the `ios` and the `android` clients.

```shell
make ios
```

and

```shell
make android
```

Note: The `android` command it applies a git patch (`patches/mobileLibsForBuild.patch`) required to swap some libs from the `go.mod` for the client to work, installs those libs, builds the client, and then reverts the patch.

## Executables

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Celo blockchain client comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`geth`** | The main Celo Blockchain client. It is the entry point into the Celo network, capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state), light node (retrieving data live), or lightest node (retrieving minimum number of block headers to verify existing validator set). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Celo network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [Ethereum CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options. |
| `abigen` | Source code generator to convert Celo contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see [Ethereum's Native DApps](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Native-DApps:-Go-bindings-to-Ethereum-contracts) wiki page for details. |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of the Celo client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks. |
| `evm` | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`). |
| `gethrpctest` | Developer utility tool to support the [ethereum/rpc-test](https://github.com/ethereum/rpc-tests) test suite which validates baseline conformity to the [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) specs. Please see the [ethereum test suite's readme](https://github.com/ethereum/rpc-tests/blob/master/README.md) for details. |
| `rlpdump` | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP)) dumps (data encoding used by the Celo protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`). |

## Running tests

Prior to running tests you will need to run `make prepare-system-contracts`.
This will checkout the celo-monorepo and compile the system contracts for use
in full network tests. The rule will copy the compiled contracts from
celo-monorepo to `compiled-system-contracts`. If you subsequently edit the
system contracts source, running the make rule again will re-compile them and
copy them into place.

This make rule will shallow checkout
[celo-monorepo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo) under
`../.celo-blockchain-monorepo-checkout` relative to this project's root, and it
will checkout the commit defined in the variable MONOREPO_COMMIT in the
Makefile. 

These values can be overridden if required, by setting those variables in the
make command, for example:
```
make prepare-system-contracts MONOREPO_COMMIT=master MONOREPO_PATH=../alt-monorepo
```

Without first running this make rule, certain tests will fail with errors such
as:

```
panic: Can't read bytecode for monorepo/packages/protocol/build/contracts/FixidityLib.json: open
```

## Running Celo

Please see the [docs.celo.org/getting-started](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/choosing-a-network) for instructions on how to run a node connected the Celo network using the prebuilt Docker image.

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here, please consult `geth --help` for more complete information.
We've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your own Celo blockchain client instance.

### Full node on the main Celo network

By default, the Celo client will connect to the Mainnet.
Running the following command will create a full node that will sync with the Celo network and allow access to all of its functionality.

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use-case the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can
fast-sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

### A Full node on the Alfajores test network

Smart contract developers will be most interested in the Alfajores testnet.
On Alfajores, you can receive testnet Celo through the [Alfajores faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) and deploy smart contracts in an environment very similar to Mainnet.
More information about the Alfajores testnet can be found on [docs.celo.org](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet).

```shell
$ geth --alfajores console
```

*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always
use separate accounts for testnet-tokens and real-tokens. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Full node on the Baklava test network

Validators and full node operators will be most interested in the Baklava testnet.
On Baklava, you can receive a distribution of testnet Celo Gold to become a validator on the network and test out running a validator for the first time, or try out new infrastructure.
More information about the Baklava testnet can be found on [docs.celo.org](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet).
A full guide to getting started as a validator on Baklava can be found in the [Getting Started guides](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet/running-a-validator-in-baklava)

```shell
$ geth --baklava console
```

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `Celo` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
<<<<<<< HEAD
Celo network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs)).

this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)).
>>>>>>> v1.10.7
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins value` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--graphql` Enable GraphQL on the HTTP-RPC server. Note that GraphQL can only be started if an HTTP server is started as well.
  * `--graphql.corsdomain value` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--graphql.vhosts value` Comma separated list of virtual hostnames from which to accept requests (server enforced). Accepts '*' wildcard. (default: "localhost")
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Celo nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be
aware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": <arbitrary positive integer>,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0
  },
  "alloc": {},
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty": "0x20000",
  "extraData": "",
  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "0x00"
}
```

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing
the `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able
to connect to you. If you'd like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create
the accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.

```json
"alloc": {
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {
    "balance": "111111111"
  },
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {
    "balance": "222222222"
  }
}
```

With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every**
`geth` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly
set:

```shell
$ geth init path/to/genesis.json
```

#### Creating the rendezvous point

With all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you'll need to
start a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over
the internet. The clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:

```shell
$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key
$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key
```

With the bootnode online, it will display an [`enode` URL](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/enode-url-format)
that other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information. Make sure to
replace the displayed IP address information (most probably `[::]`) with your externally
accessible IP to get the actual `enode` URL.

*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `geth` node as a bootnode, but it's the less
recommended way.*

#### Starting up your member nodes

With the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try
`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it's indeed reachable), start every subsequent `geth`
node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will
probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so
do also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.

```shell
$ geth --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>
```

*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you'll
also need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*

#### Running a private miner

Mining on the public Ethereum network is a complex task as it's only feasible using GPUs,
requiring an OpenCL or CUDA enabled `ethminer` instance. For information on such a
setup, please consult the [EtherMining subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/)
and the [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) repository.

In a private network setting, however a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for
practical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals
without needing heavy resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple
ones either). To start a `geth` instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended
by:

```shell
$ geth <usual-flags> --mine --miner.threads=1 --etherbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Which will start mining blocks and transactions on a single CPU thread, crediting all
proceedings to the account specified by `--etherbase`. You can further tune the mining
by changing the default gas limit blocks converge to (`--targetgaslimit`) and the price
transactions are accepted at (`--gasprice`).

### Submitting an issue

If you come across a bug, pleas open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/new) with information about your build and what happened.

### CI Testing and automerge

We run a circle CI test suite on each PR. The following tests are required to
merge a PR.
  * Unit tests: `make test` or `./build/env.sh go run build/ci.go test`
  * Lint: `make lint` (Fix go format errors with `gofmt -s`)
  * Build: `make`
  * End to end sync and transfer tests
  * Check imports: `./scripts/check_imports.sh`

 `celo-blockchain` is based on `go-ethereum`, but the import path has been renamed from `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` to `github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain`.
 Developers are encouraged to run `./scripts/setup_git_hooks.sh` to enable checking that import path has been changed to `celo-org` on `git merge` and `git commit`.
 Imports can automatically be renamed with `./scripts/rename_imports.sh`.


Individual package tests can be run with
`./build/env.sh go test github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/$(PATH_TO_GO_PACKAGE)`
if you don't have `GOPATH` set-up.


Once a PR is approved, adding on the `automerge` label will keep it up to date
and do a squash merge once all the required tests have passed.

### Benchmarking

Golang has built in support for running benchmarks with go tool
`go test -run=ThisIsNotATestName -bench=. ./$PACKAGE_NAME` will run all benchmarks in a package.

One note around running benchmarks is that `BenchmarkHandlePreprepare` is quite takes a while to run, particularly when testing with a larger number of validators.
Substituting `-bench=REGEX` for `-bench=.` will specify which tests to run. Adding `-cpuprofile=cpu.out` which can be visualized with `go tool pprof -html:8080 cpu.out` if `graphviz` is installed.

See the [go testing flags](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Testing_flags) and [go docs](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Benchmarks) for more information on benchmarking.
